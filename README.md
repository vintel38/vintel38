## Hi all 👋

After an aeronautical engineering degree and a MS in aerospace engineering, I am interested in new technologies like AI, data and connectivity. Currently working as System Engineer on the Ariane6 rocket, I am looking for new opportunities in Paris area mixing aerospace industry and data emerging solutions opportunities. 

- 🔭 Working here : Ariane6 Launch Software System Engineer
- 🎓 Graduated from : OpenClassrooms Machine Learning Engineer Course
- 🌱 Learning this : IA, Computer Vision, Data Science & Embedded Systems
- 👯 Collaborating with : IA and start-up meetup in Paris
- 📫 Reach me there : varrigoni382@hotmail.fr

🔬 Some of my projects

- Reproducing Top performance models on [Kaggle Airbus Ship Detection challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/airbus-ship-detection/overview) with customized [MyDetectron2](https://github.com/vintel38/MyDetectron2) repository
- Proposing [global warming solution](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/my-rooftop-project-a-satellite-imagery-computer-vision-example-e45a296129a0) for urban areas during [ESA Copernicus Masters](https://copernicus-masters.com/) 2021 using [Mask RCNN](https://github.com/vintel38/RoofTop-Project), [INRIA opensource dataset](https://project.inria.fr/aerialimagelabeling/) and [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps?hl=fr) to cool down buildings with dark roofs
- Deploying high accuracy (98,5%) classification model to [HuggingFaces Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vintel38/OCS-P7-IML) by fine-tuning EfficientNetV4 Keras model
